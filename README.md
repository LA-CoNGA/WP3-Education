# Training and Education

WP3 (Training and education) is designed to accomplish the implementation of the master one year program including development of the e-learning mini-modules with content related to the theoretical side: quantum field theory, particle and statistical physics as well as cutting-edge instrumentation and data analysis. 

We, at UNI-Peru (and UNMSM?) suggested a "normal" master peruvian program, at least for Peru. Here in Peru (for all the peruvian universities) we have a master program of, at least, 48 credits (16 teaching hours/credit, which must be presential (face-to-face)). In our master programs in Physics we have in the first semester some compulsory basic courses (Electromagnetism, Quantum Mechanics, Classical Mechanics). We have as well in the last two semesters the courses of Seminar Thesis I and II. Being Seminar Thesis I the prerequisite for Seminar Thesis II. And to carry out a Seminar Thesis I, there must be a minimum of credits, so the fastest that a master's degree can be completed is in three semesters. We propose that the students start in our programs and in the first semester they will take our compulsory "basic" courses. In the second semester they would take the mini-modules for theoretical, instrumentation and data analysis. In the third semester they would go to the stay for training in intrnational research centers. They need as well an original research thesis to get the master degree.
